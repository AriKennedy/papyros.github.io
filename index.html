        <h5 class="center">Material Design</h5>

        <p class="light">We're building the desktop and apps following the Material Design standard which Google created and uses in Android and many of their web apps. This means the operating system will look great, be easy to use and understand, and have a high degree of polish and animations.</p>

        <h5 class="center">Open Source</h5>

        <p class="light">We believe that open source is the best way to develop software. All our code is publically available on GitHub, even before the alpha is released. We also share progress and discuss new ideas on our Google+ page and community and on our mailing list.</p>
