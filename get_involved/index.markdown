Whether you are a developer, designer, translator, or just a regular user, there are many ways to
contribute to Papyros.

You can also donate to Papyros to fund development or web hosting. All donations will go directly
to web hosting and server costs and bug bounties (once we set them up). Once we have bug bounties set
up, any donations left over after hosting and server costs will be split among the highest priority
bug reports on GitHub and anyone with the necessary skills can fix the bug and claim the bug bounty.

### Development ###

 * If you're familiar with QML, you can contribute to our
   [Material Design app framework](https://github.com/papyros/qml-material) or the
   [desktop shell](https://github.com/papyros/papyros-shell) itself.
 * If you prefer C++, you can help by implementing backends for the desktop shell indicators and
   other features in the [desktop library](https://github.com/papyros/qml-desktop)
 * If you want to help build the base operating system, including work on using OSTree and xdg-app,
   check out the [powerpack](https://github.com/papyros/powerpack) repository.

### Translations ###

The project is still in active development, and doesn't fully support translating yet. We'll add
support for translations, and would love to have your help!

### Design ###

We care a lot about the design of Papyros. You can check out our [mockups](https://github.com/papyros/mockups),
or join the discusson in the Papyros community on Google+ by submitting mockups or commenting on
others' mockups.

### Bug Reports ###

Once we have an alpha release, bug reports are a great way to contribute to Papyros, whether you're
a developer, designer, or tester. We plan to have a bug reporting app in the OS, but you can also
file bugs in the appropriate project on [GitHub](https://github.com/papyros).
