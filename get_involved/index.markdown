Whether you are a developer, designer, translator, or just a regular user, there are many ways to contribute to Papyros.

You can also support development of Papyros by donating to fund development and web hosting. Bug bounties are a way of paying developers, both from the Papyros team and third-party contributors, for their work in fixing bugs or implementing features. You can donate to specific features or bugs that matter to you or to the project in general. Either way, you get to see exactly where your funds are going. You can also donate via Paypal to help support web hosting and server costs. For PayPal donations, you can view a donation report in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eglrkBnZS1Qmj6vwMYTESDzZF5DJxwQB8I7GqnOFnX0/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Development

 * If you're familiar with QML, you can contribute to our
   [Material Design app framework](https://github.com/papyros/qml-material) or the
   [desktop shell](https://github.com/papyros/papyros-shell) itself.
 * If you prefer C++, you can help by implementing backends for the desktop shell indicators and
   other features in the [desktop library](https://github.com/papyros/qml-desktop)
 * If you want to help build the base operating system, including work on using OSTree and xdg-app,
   check out the [powerpack](https://github.com/papyros/powerpack) repository.

#### Translations

The project is still in active development, and doesn't fully support translating yet. We'll add
support for translations, and would love to have your help!

#### Design

We care a lot about the design of Papyros. You can check out our [mockups](https://github.com/papyros/mockups),
or join the discusson in the Papyros community on Google+ by submitting mockups or commenting on
others' mockups.

#### Bug Reports

Once we have an alpha release, bug reports are a great way to contribute to Papyros, whether you're
a developer, designer, or tester. We plan to have a bug reporting app in the OS, but you can also
file bugs in the appropriate project on [GitHub](https://github.com/papyros).
