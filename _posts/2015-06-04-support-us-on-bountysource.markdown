Our vision for Papyros is building a Linux operating system that is fun and easy to use for the average user. We're doing this by building an operating system that gets out of the user's way, integrates with cloud services and web technologies, and converges across devices and form factors.

Papyros currently has no commercial funding, and development is done by team members and third-party contributors in their spare time. Today I'm excited to announce a new crowdfunding campaign on Bountysource Salt! You can choose a monthly reoccurring subscription amount to help fund Papyros, and earn rewards such as getting your name listed on our website's [Sponsors](/sponsors) page. And if you sponsor us with a large enough subscription, we'll put your logo and name directly on our [About](/about) page (perfect for commercial funding!). Help us reach our goals and make Papyros an awesome OS!

With continual funding, the Papyros team will be able to dedicate more time to working on Papyros as well as pay third-party contributors to work on features and bugs through the use of bug bounties. This will allow me, Michael Spencer, to spend more time as the lead developer building new features of the OS, getting the alpha ready for testing, and working towards stable releases of the operating system. It will also encourage more third-party contributors to get involved with development of the OS.

Unlike crowdfunding campaigns like Kickstarter, Indiegogo, or Patreon, where you can't see where funding goes, supporting Papyros on Bountysource Salt lets you see exactly where your contributions go. You can see exactly what features and bugs you're helping fund by checking out our [bounties page](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/papyros/bounties). If you're a developer, you're able to jump in, find bugs you can fix or features you can implement, and earn bug bounties yourself!

We're planning on releasing the first alpha of the OS this summer, with a stable release later this year. With your help funding the devlopment of Papyros, we'd like to continue working towards fulfilling our vision of building an open-source operating system that is fun and easy to use for the average user yet advanced enough for power users, including building the following features:

 * A selection of core apps that conform to Material Design and integrate tightly with the operating system
 * Intelligent, persistent notifications, similar to the notifications on Android
 * User account restrictions, useful for parental controls, library and coffee shop computers, and other restricted environments
 * Application bundles and sandboxing, supporting GNOME's work on cross-distro apps and a polished app store
 * Presentation mode, providing a simple way to present to an external display
 * Convergence, or adapting to the device and input methods Papyros is running on

You can read more about our goals on our [About page](/about).

So, what are you waiting for? Go [check out our new page](https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/papyros) and share it with everyone you know! We’d love it if you’d subscribe there and help us fund the development of a really awesome project :)
