On the surface, Papyros is all about the bringing latest trends to Linux. Features include Material Design, a stable rolling release architecture with atomic upgrades and rollbacks, and a simple and easy to use desktop environment. But our vision for Papyros goes far deeper and transcends the modern features and design. Our vision for Papyros is to build a powerful yet easy-to-use operating system focused on empowering users to do great things. We're doing this by building an operating system that gets out of the user's way, integrates with cloud services and weby getting out of the user's way and integrating with cloud services and web technologies, and converging across devices and form factors.

We're building a modern Linux-based operating system and several related projects. So far we've released a cross-platform Material Design application development framework for QtQuick, and are scheduled to release the first version of our desktop environment in July.

Some of the current features we're working on include:

 * Focus on modern design by conforming to Google's Material Design guidelines
 * A rolling release architecture with atomic upgrades and rollbacks
 * Integration with web apps such as Gmail, Inbox, and Evernote
 * A simple and easy to use desktop environment
 * A cross-platform app development framework based on QtQuick

Papyros currently has no commercial funding, and development is done by team members and third-party contributors in their spare time. With additional, the Papyros team will be able to dedicate more time to working on Papyros as well as pay third-party contributors to work on features and bugs through the use of bug bounties. 

To fulfil our vision of building an open-source operating system that empowers the user, with your support, we'd like to add the following features:

##### Intelligent notifications

We'd like to extend the existing notification specification for Linux to support intelligent notifications that persist as long as the original content is unread. For example, a notification will show until you read an email or open your chat program, but will automatically go away once you read the email or chat. We also will display the persistent notifications in a top panel similar to Android to provide at-a-glance identification of which apps have notifications.

##### User account restrictions

User account restrictions are useful for parental controls, library and coffee shop computers, and other restricted environments. We'd like to build a simple UI settings module to restrict access to parts of the user's account and desktop, such as what apps are pinned, which apps can be opened or are hidden, whether the user can change networks, or log out or power off the computer.

##### Application bundles and sandboxing

GNOME is working on cross-distro and cross-desktop environment application bundling and sandboxing. We'd like to use this technology to build modern application bundling support for Papyros, allowing you to install Papyros apps on any distro or any bundled app on Papyros, even if it was built and packaged on another distro.

Along with this, we'd like to build an elegant app store UI to manage and install these application bundles.

##### Presentation mode

We'd like to build a simple and easy-to-use presentation mode that turns an external display into a presentation screen, with an easy way to present specific windows on the display, without having to deal with the hassle of trying to drag windows onto the display and fullscreen them. This mode would also disable notifications and screen locking while enabled.

##### Convergence

If Papyros becomes successful enough, we'd like to eventually implement convergence. This would include different interfaces for different devices, such as tablets, phones, and TVs. We'd also like to work on support for convertible laptops, where removing the keyboard and touchpad turns the device into a tablet mode, losing windowed mode and making the screen more touch-focused.
